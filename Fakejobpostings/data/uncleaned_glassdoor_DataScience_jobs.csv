About PerfectRec
PerfectRec is a machine-learning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good, personalized recommendations without exhaustive research. Our goals are to get each person the best product for them, while saving time and money. We aim to attract billions of users, collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches, and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves at the lowest price.
We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. We then plan to recommend other products such as cars and clothing, and then ultimately we’ll expand into other, more complicated decisions such as where to live or work. (Since you’re reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.)

Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. Making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money. We're solving the problem by combining actual human subject-area experts with machine learning to help everyone — regardless of their expertise — find their perfect product, quickly. To do that, we guide users through a series of questions about what they're looking for. After each answer, we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations. We get more information about a user's specific needs from our quick and easy multiple-choice questions than e-commerce sites and search engines can deduce from search queries and past browsing data. Answers to our questions allow us to make better recommendations tailored to each user's unique needs.

Today, 112 million Americans have trouble paying for healthcare. Nearly 1 in 4 Americans have medical debt. Healthcare costs are skyrocketing, and patients are facing more of that financial burden. We started Milu Health to tackle this problem.


WHO WE ARE
Milu Health is an early stage startup focused on making healthcare affordable for Americans.

Using healthcare pricing data - a 500TB healthcare cost dataset that payers recently have had to release publicly for the first time ever - combined with other healthcare quality and claims data, we think we can change how employers and employees pay for healthcare and ultimately make high-quality medical care more affordable for patients.

Our tools comprise an operating system to reduce a patient's personal healthcare spend - from helping patients identify which high-quality and high-value doctors to go to for a procedure, to informing them about the most affordable prescription options for their medicines, to making sure their medical bills are correct. Through our entire stack, we engage patients through our consumer-facing products and cash-back incentives that can cover their out-of-pocket spend.

We're looking for the best people in the world to dig and build something great with us. It's not going to be easy. There's going to be twists and turns, successes and failures, and tons of learning. But we're in this for the long haul and believe we can fundamentally change a broken system.

Square builds common business tools in unconventional ways so more people can start, run, and grow their businesses.

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.
So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place.
